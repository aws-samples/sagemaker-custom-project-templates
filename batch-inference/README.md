    - Update the Product Information. The product name and description are visible inside of SageMaker Studio. Other fields are visible to users that consume this directly through Service Catalog. 

    - Support information is not available inside of SageMaker Studio, but is available in the Service Catalog Dashboard.

    - Updating the source code repository information is only necessary if you forked this repo and modified it.
